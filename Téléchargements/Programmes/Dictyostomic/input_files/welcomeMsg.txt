This program will allow you to get the expression profile
of genes you are interested in, in Dictyostelium discoideum.

All these transcriptomic data are provided by two RNA-seq 
analyses, led by Pakhir et al. (2010) and by Rosengarten et 
al. (2015):

- Pakhir, Miranda, Katoh-Kurasawa, Fuller, Rot, Zagar, Curk, 
Sucgang, Chen, Zupan, Loomis, Kuspa, Shaulsky. (2010) Conserved
developmental transcriptomes in evolutionarily divergent species.
Genome Biology, 11:R35
- Rosengarten, Santhanman, Fuller, Katoh-Kurasawa, Loomis, 
Zupan, Shaulsky. (2015) Leaps and lulls in the developmental
transcriptome of Dictyostelium discoideum. Biomedical Central
Genomics, 16:194

This program will coordinates data mining tools and R, in order
to provide you :
- the expression profile of a gene, as a function of hour in
the life cycle of D. discoideum
- the average expression profile of a gene, as a function of 
phenotype during the slug stage

It can also allow one to compare expression profiles of a small
set genes
