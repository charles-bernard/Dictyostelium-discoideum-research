This program will allow you to get the clusters of expression 
profiles of either all pst genes or all psp genes 
in Dictyostelium discoideum. It can also generate the 
individual expression profile of each of these genes 

All these transcriptomic data are provided by two RNA-seq 
analyses, led by Pakhir et al. (2010) and by Rosengarten et 
al. (2015):

- Pakhir, Miranda, Katoh-Kurasawa, Fuller, Rot, Zagar, Curk, 
Sucgang, Chen, Zupan, Loomis, Kuspa, Shaulsky. (2010) Conserved
developmental transcriptomes in evolutionarily divergent species.

transcriptome of Dictyostelium discoideum. Biomedical Central

This program will coordinates data mining tools and R, in order
to provide you :
- the expression clusters of pst and psp gene
- the expression profile of a gene, as a function of hour in
the life cycle of D. discoideum
- the average expression profile of a gene, as a function of 
phenotype during the slug stage
